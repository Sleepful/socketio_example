# Socketio Example
Socketio with react and namespaces

This was inspired by the following article:

[Real Time Web App | React.js + Express + Socket.io](https://codeburst.io/isomorphic-web-app-react-js-express-socket-io-e2f03a469cd3)

In the article the author uses react in a way that lends itself to errors so I fixed it and uploaded it here, additionally this example includes `namespaces` feature of socket.io

This comment mentions why it is problematic and running the author's code with any modification is enough for bugs to be unavoidable
