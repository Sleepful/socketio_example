# Socketio Example
Socketio with react and namespaces

This was inspired by the following article:

[Real Time Web App | React.js + Express + Socket.io](https://codeburst.io/isomorphic-web-app-react-js-express-socket-io-e2f03a469cd3)

In the article the author uses react in a way that lends itself to errors so I fixed it and uploaded it here, additionally this example includes `namespaces` feature of socket.io

This comment from the medium article mentions why the implementation from the article above is problematic, running the author's code with any modification is enough for bugs to be unavoidable

Side note: the author of that blog post decided to block me from their medium after I posted this repository in the comments  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
